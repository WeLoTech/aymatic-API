# Introduction

Welcome to the aymatic API! You can use our API to access aymatic API endpoints, which can get information on various cats, kittens, and breeds in our database.

We have language bindings in Shell (cURL)! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.


# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:


```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: YOUR_KEY"
```

```javascript
const aymatic = require('aymatic');

let api = aymatic.authorize('YOUR_KEY');
```

> Make sure to replace `YOUR_KEY` with your API key.

aymatic uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new aymatic API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

aymatic expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: YOUR_KEY`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>YOUR_KEY</code> with your personal API key.
